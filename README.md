#### About game
The Question.csv file has questions, correct answers and explanations.
The computer asks the player questions from a file.

The player must answer "yes" or "no" ("y" or "n"). The number of attempts is limited.

If there are too many mistakes - a loss, 
if the player has reached the end and did not exceed the allowed number of mistakes - a victory.

You need to copy directory and run the **client.py** file for playing.

`python3 client.py`
